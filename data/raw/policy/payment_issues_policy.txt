Payment Issues Policy

1. If payment is deducted but the order is not confirmed, the deducted amount is automatically refunded.
2. In the case of duplicate or double payment, only the excess amount is refunded.
3. EMI or bank-side payment failures may require the customer to contact their bank after verification from the platform.
4. All payment-related issues must be treated as high-priority tickets.
5. No payment-related ticket should be auto-closed without confirmation of resolution.
