Refund Policy

1. Refunds are issued only after verifying the order status and payment confirmation.
2. If an item is damaged, defective, or incorrect, the customer is eligible for either a full refund or a replacement, based on availability.
3. Refunds are always processed to the original payment method used at checkout.
4. Once approved, refunds usually reflect within:
   - 3 to 5 business days for UPI, wallets, and debit/credit cards
   - 5 to 7 business days for net banking transactions
5. If a refund is delayed beyond the stated timeline, the ticket must be escalated to the finance team for manual verification.

Non-refundable cases:
- Items marked as non-returnable
- Orders cancelled after shipment unless the item is damaged, defective, or incorrect
